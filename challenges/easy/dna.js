/*
Problem:
input: two strings 
output: a number, representing the number of dirernces between the two strings


Examples: See testing code


Data Structures:
A class that contains two methods and one property:
constructor:
    declares strand property

hammingDistance:
    calculates the number of differences between the strand string and the
    input sting


Algorithm:
FOR hammindDistance methdod:
    takes one string input:
        delcare a counter
        loop through the this.strand string
            on each char, compare the current char to the current char of the
            input string
            if they are different add one to a counter
            return the count
